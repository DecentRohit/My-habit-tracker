Tracker day to day habit made using react

React app to track habits for seven days of week. We can add, delete and change status of each habit for a day. Habits not get deleted on page reloads, as it is stored in LocalStorage of browser. Implement state using redux-toolkit and styled components using react-bootstrap. And always no login/signup to keep simple and quick enough.
